# Configuration Reference

CodeCanary uses a `.codecanary/config.yml` file in your repository. The setup wizard creates this file for you, but you can edit it directly.

## Config file locations

The `--config` flag always takes precedence when provided. Otherwise, config resolution depends on context:

**GitHub Actions**: uses the repo-level `.codecanary/config.yml` (walks up from the working directory). Legacy `.codecanary.yml` at repo root is also supported with a deprecation warning.

**Local CLI**: uses `~/.codecanary/repos/<owner>/<repo>/config.yml` (created by `codecanary setup local`). Falls back to the legacy global `~/.codecanary/config.yml` with a deprecation warning. The repo-level `.codecanary/config.yml` is not used locally — it's for CI only.

## Provider configs

### Anthropic (native API with prompt caching)

```yaml
version: 1
provider: anthropic
review_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
triage_model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
# api_key_env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  # default
```

### OpenAI

```yaml
version: 1
provider: openai
review_model: gpt-5.4
triage_model: gpt-5.4-mini
# api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY  # default
# api_base: https://api.openai.com/v1  # default; override for Azure, Ollama, etc.
```

### OpenRouter

```yaml
version: 1
provider: openrouter
review_model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
triage_model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
# api_key_env: OPENROUTER_API_KEY  # default
```

### Claude CLI

```yaml
version: 1
provider: claude
review_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
triage_model: haiku
```

Uses your Claude CLI's authentication — make sure you're logged in by running `claude`.

#### Extra CLI arguments

Use `claude_args` to pass additional flags to the Claude CLI invocation:

```yaml
provider: claude
review_model: sonnet
triage_model: haiku
claude_args:
  - "--mcp-config=/path/to/mcp.json"
```

All elements must be flags (starting with `-`). Use `--flag=value` form for flags that take a value — bare values like `"/path/to/file"` are rejected to prevent positional argument injection.

The following flags are managed by codecanary and cannot appear in `claude_args`:
`--print`, `--output-format`, `--no-session-persistence`, `--model`, `--max-budget-usd`.

Use `claude_path` to point to a non-default binary (e.g. a beta release):

```yaml
claude_path: /usr/local/bin/claude-beta
```

## Models

`review_model` has a sensible default per provider. `triage_model` is required — there is no default, since providers like OpenRouter can proxy any model.

| Provider | Review default | Triage (example) |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| `openai` | `gpt-5.4` | `gpt-5.4-mini` |
| `openrouter` | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| `claude` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `haiku` |

## Budget enforcement

`max_budget_usd` caps total spending per review run. Set to `0` (default) for unlimited.

| Provider | How it works |
|----------|-------------|
| `claude` | Passed as `--max-budget-usd` to the CLI (enforced mid-stream). The runner also checks between calls as an additional safeguard. |
| `anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter` | Enforced by the runner between LLM calls. After the triage phase completes, spending is checked before starting the review call. During parallel triage, each new evaluation is skipped once the budget is exceeded (already-running evaluations finish). |

Because checks happen _between_ calls, a single call can push spending over the limit — the cap is enforced before the _next_ call starts.

## Severity levels

| Level | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `critical` | Security vulnerabilities, data loss, crashes |
| `bug` | Logic errors, incorrect behavior |
| `warning` | Potential issues, performance problems, code smells |
| `suggestion` | Better patterns, readability improvements |
| `nitpick` | Minor style, naming, formatting |

## Split config: review.yml

You can optionally split review-specific settings into `.codecanary/review.yml`. If present, its `rules`, `context`, and `ignore` fields override those in `config.yml`. This lets you keep provider/model config separate from review rules.

```yaml
# .codecanary/review.yml
context: |
  Go REST API using chi router. Tests use testify.

rules:
  - id: error-handling
    description: "Errors must be wrapped with context using fmt.Errorf"
    severity: warning
    paths: ["**/*.go"]

ignore:
  - "dist/**"
  - "*.lock"
```

### Per-rule path scoping

A rule's optional `paths` and `exclude_paths` globs scope it to specific files. A rule is injected into the review prompt only when at least one changed file matches `paths` (and is not matched by `exclude_paths`). A rule with no `paths`/`exclude_paths` applies to every review. This keeps the prompt focused — a Go-only rule won't be sent when a PR only touches TypeScript — and uses the same `**` glob syntax as `ignore`.

```yaml
rules:
  - id: go-error-handling
    description: "Errors must be wrapped with context using fmt.Errorf"
    severity: warning
    paths: ["**/*.go"]
    exclude_paths: ["**/*_test.go"]
```

## Project docs auto-discovery

CodeCanary automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` files as additional review context. The root `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` are always included. Nested `<dir>/CLAUDE.md` files at any depth (e.g. `apps/web/CLAUDE.md`, `engines/billing/CLAUDE.md`) are included only when a changed file lives under that directory, so monorepo reviews load just the relevant package docs. Per-file cap is 64KB, total cap is 128KB, across up to 20 files.

## Path-scoped rules (`.claude/rules/*.md`)

CodeCanary also reads Claude Code rule files from `.claude/rules/*.md` so you don't have to duplicate conventions into `review.yml`. Each rule file may begin with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: API endpoints must use the auth middleware
paths:
  - "apps/api/**"
---

All new endpoints under `apps/api` must register the shared auth middleware
before any handler logic. Reject requests with a 401 when the token is absent.
```

A rule is included in the review prompt only when a changed file matches one of its `paths` globs (using the same `**` glob syntax as `ignore`). A rule file with no `paths` frontmatter is always included. Rules have their own byte budget — 8KB per file, 32KB total — independent of the CLAUDE.md caps; oversized rules are truncated with a warning.

## Draft PRs

Draft PRs are skipped by default in the GitHub Actions workflow. When you convert a draft to ready, CodeCanary triggers automatically.

To review draft PRs, remove the `github.event.pull_request.draft == false` condition from the workflow `if` in `.github/workflows/codecanary.yml`.
